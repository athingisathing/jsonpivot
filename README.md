json.pivot

This will be a pivot for json objects... I have it working in my code, but I have never built a plugging so i have just hacked together the script I had to give an outline of where im headed.

I know the code differentials can all be in one script, but I separated them into separate functions to show examples.

I looked high and low and the only pivot functions i found had all these bloated tables and crap around them. This is just a pivot plain and simple. It can pivot 19,000 plus rows with sub second times and will also return columns if needed...(many grids need columns)

I would like to build a column template tool to allow the system to fill column values with specific values from data.


Also I would like to add in grouping... 

I am using this in node.js and would love a npm wrapper also.


Hope this helps and I hope people help. Thanks
